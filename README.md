[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/yazeed44/maven/multi-image-picker/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/yazeed44/maven/multi-image-picker/_latestVersion)

Also don't forget to add [cwac-cam2](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-cam2) repository by declaring this in your ```build.gradle```

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://repo.commonsware.com.s3.amazonaws.com"
    }
}

```


### If jCenter is Having Issues (the library can't be resolved)

Add this to your app's build.gradle file:

```Gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/yazeed44/maven' }
}
```


Getting started
==========

It's easy

-Define a style that uses a toolbar instead of actionbar , if you have already has a style who does that skip this step
```xml
<style name="MIP_theme" parent="AppTheme">

    <item name="windowActionBar">false</item>
    <item name="windowNoTitle">true</item>

</style>
```

```java
private void pickImages(){
       
    //You can change many settings in builder like limit , Pick mode and colors
    new Picker.Builder(this,new MyPickListener(),R.style.MIP_theme)
        .build()
        .startActivity();

}
    
private class MyPickListener implements Picker.PickListener {

    @Override
    public void onPickedSuccessfully(final ArrayList<ImageEntry> images) {
        doSomethingWithImages(images);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCancel() {
        //User canceled the pick activity
    }
}
```

## Make Photo/Video capture optional

In order to capture photos and videos the library depends on [cwac-cam2](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-cam2) library.
If you just want to pick images from gallery you can disable the capture feature by excluding the `cwac-cam2` library from your module:

```gradle
compile('net.yazeed44.imagepicker:imagepicker:1.3.1') {
    exclude module: 'cam2'
}
// or
configurations.compile.exclude module: 'cam2'
```
